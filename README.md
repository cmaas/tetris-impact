### How to Install

Get the sources, download Impact.js (you need a license), unzip it. You have a folder in there called `impact/lib/impact` that contains the engine's source code.

Copy it and place it in the Tetris source code under `lib/`.
There's a text file showing the right location.

Have fun.
